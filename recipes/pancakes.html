        <li>300g flour</li>
        <li>60g sugar</li>
        <li>4ts baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4ts baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2ts salt</li>
        <li>450ml milk</li>
        <li>60g butter</li>
        <li>2ts vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).</p></li>
    <li><p>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. </p></li>
    <li><p>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</p></li>
    <li><p>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</p></li>
    <li><p>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</p></li>
